# How To Run My Code
To run the RRT for searching throuh 3-D spaces, simply run ```python3 RRT_3D.py```.To run the 2-D implementation, simply run ```python3 RRT_2D.py```

# Description
The Rapidly Exploring Random Tree is a path planning algorithm. It effectively searches through high dimensional spaces for viable paths from one state to another. It easily lends itself to spaces with constraints and arbitrary obstacles. It is commonly used in robotics. (Cite example?). My implementation searches through 2-D and 3-D spaces with circular and spherical obstacles. It returns a viable path from the inital position to the desired postion while avoiding the obstacles.
